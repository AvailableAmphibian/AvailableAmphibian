## Hi there
I am **HFDrae** and I am a student in Computer Science in France!  
My profile picture is from `「蜘蛛ですがなにか？」` (aka: "I'm a spider, so what ?"). 

### I am currently working on :
- an Android weather app (Pretty original, isn't it ?) in Kotlin...
- creating then hosting on a Raspberry PI my own SMTP server *and try to make it secured enough D:*

### I am currently planning to work on :
- The [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (probably in Kotlin if I don't care... *grinning*) <- Probably the next one up after the weather app
- A website using Kotlin/JS... 
- Doing a complete RogueLike


### I have learnt about :
- Java -> Good experience
- C -> Solid basis
- Kotlin -> Still learning
- SQL -> Basis
- Vanilla JavaScript, Angular, TypeScript and WebDev -> Basis
- Android Dev (Kotlin / Java) -> Solid experience
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, MX Linux, Garuda, Arch, Pop_OS) -> Solid basis

### I'd also like to learn about :
- Rust or Cpp or maybe Go
- Kotlin/JS
- Ruby/RoR
- Security
- Artificial Intelligences

I am also a member of the [Camiraz](https://github.com/Camiraz) Organization (just some friends)!
